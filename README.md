# Spotify-Playlist-Classification
Playlist classification using variables of artist, album, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, & tempo. Analytical techniques compared logistic regression vs. variations of SVM. 
Data was scraped using Spotify's API, playlists selected were those I recently listened to.
